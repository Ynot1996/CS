# Fundamental Sorting Concepts

## Bubble Sort

Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

#### 88. Merge Sorted Array

[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/description/)

## Selection Sort

Selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first unsorted element.

#### 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array

[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/description/)

## Insertion Sort

Builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting elements into their correct position.

#### 147. Insertion Sort List

[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/insertion-sort-list/description/)

# Efficient Sorting Algorithms

## Merge Sort

Divide-and-conquer strategy that splits the array in half, recursively sorts them, and merges them back together.

#### 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/description/)

## Quick Sort

Choose a pivot, partition the array around the pivot, and recursively sort the subarrays.

#### 75. Sort Colors

[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/description/)

## Heap Sort

Builds a heap (max or min) and repeatedly extracts the largest (or smallest) element.

#### 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array

[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/Kth-Largest-Element-in-an-Array/description/)

# Advanced Sorting Algorithms

## Counting Sort

Sorts integers by counting the frequency of each value and uses this to place them in the correct position.

#### 912. Sort an Array

[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/description/)

## Radix Sort

Sorts numbers by processing digits from least significant to most significant.

#### 164. Maximum Gap

[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-gap/description/)

## Bucket Sort

Divides the input into several "buckets," sorts each bucket, and combines the results.

#### 164. Maximum Gap

[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-gap/description/)
