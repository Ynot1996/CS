## Move Zeroes
[283](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)

Question: 
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.<br>
Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
